# Nodeapp

Base application to start node.js backends with express.js

## Getting started

You must install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download dependencies, build and test the project.

Please install [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) to watch files and restart the application during development.

    npm install -g nodemon

To start the project:

    git clone git@github.com:kuffel/nodeapp.git
    cd <PROJECT_DIR>
    npm install
    bower install
    grunt run

Nodemon will start the main.js file and watch for changes on any file in your project folder.

The console output will tell you in which port your node application is listening for requests.
